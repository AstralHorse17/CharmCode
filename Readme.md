# ✨ CharmCode Theme

A neon‑infused VSCode theme that adds a touch of magic to your editor. Inspired by cyberpunk palettes, monospace elegance, and the charm of curated iconography.

## 🎨 Overview

CharmCode is a VSCode color theme designed for developers who love vibrant syntax highlighting, readable contrast, and a hint of magical flair. It draws inspiration from:

Charmmono Theme (File Icons Only) – used solely for its clean, minimal file‑icon set

IDX Theme & IDX Xcode – for its general layout and Xcode-inspired feel

Xcode Syntax Themes (Default Dark – Catalina) – for its syntax coloring and semantic clarity
